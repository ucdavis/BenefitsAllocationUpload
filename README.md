        A Project for Automating
        General Ledger Current Budget Adjustments
        necessitated by campus' de-centralization
        of benefits allocation credits and expenses.

        This web application allows users to generate "flat" upload files
        containing all Chart 3, OP Fund 19900, Object Consolidation Codes SUB6 and SB28
        current budget (CB) and credit/expense (AC) amounts.

        <li>
            Departmental accounts containing benefit expenses are credited back by matching amounts withdrawn from the Dean's Office's central benefits accounts.

        Files can then be downloaded to users computers, reviewed, approved and uploaded
        to the Accounting and Financial Services (A&FS) host computer via Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP).
        Once uploaded, these "scrubber" files are then imported into DaFIS and scrubber results reports are
        returned via e-mail to BenefitsAllocationUpload@caes.ucdavis.edu.
